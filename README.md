# IN3063-Group-15
This repository contains the coursework submission for the **IN3063: Mathematics and Programming for AI** module. It is split into two tasks:

## Task 1: Neural Network Implementation for Classification Using NumPy
### Features:
- CIFAR-10 dataset
- Implementation of key neural network components (Sigmoid, ReLU, and Softmax)
- Use of optimisers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and SGD with Momentum

### Task 2: Implementing deep learning networks using PyTorch
### Features:

Analysis and visualisation of results is available in the report file.
